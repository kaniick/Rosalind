Problem
Given: Two positive integers a and b (a<b<10000).
Return: The sum of all odd integers from a through b, inclusively.

Sample Dataset
100 200

Sample Output
7500

Hint
You can use a % 2 == 1 to test if a is odd.

Dataset Given:
4003 8826

Code:
a=4003
b=8826
sum(i for i in xrange(a, b) if i%2)

Solution:
