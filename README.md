Rosalind Online Learning of Bioinformatics

Learning bioinformatics usually requires solving computational problems of varying difficulty that are extracted from real challenges of molecular biology.

To make learning bioinformatics fun and easy, we have founded Rosalind, a platform for learning bioinformatics through problem solving.

Rosalind offers an array of intellectually stimulating problems that grow in biological and computational complexity; each problem is checked automatically, so that the only resource required to learn bioinformatics is an internet connection.

Rosalind also promises to facilitate improvements in standard bioinformatics education by providing a vital teaching aid and a central homework resource.

Rosalind is inspired by Project Euler, Google Code Jam, and the ever growing movement of free online courses. The project's name commemorates Rosalind Franklin, whose X-ray crystallography with Raymond Gosling facilitated the discovery of the DNA double helix by Watson and Crick.
